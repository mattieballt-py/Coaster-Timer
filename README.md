# Coaster-Timer
No more cold tea or hours forgetting to drink water. A coaster that mechanically begins a timer to remind you to pick up your beverage. 

Fully mechanical. This project began as a joke but is being pursued for creative and 'for fun' purposes. 
The coaster platform allows a mug or glass of water (dual purpose device!) to be placed. The weight of it initiates a timing mechanism. As the escapement is pretty, it's not boxed in, making it a desk decoration. 

This project requires: initial brainstorming, CAD of design, prototyping feasability, iterating CAD design, 3D Printing, machining, and final assembly.

Aim is to start and complete it summer 2024.
